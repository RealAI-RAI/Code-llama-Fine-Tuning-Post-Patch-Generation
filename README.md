# CodeLlama 2 Post Patch Generation

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script for generating post-patch code snippets using CodeLlama 2, a state-of-the-art language model. The script performs fine-tuning on a given dataset to adapt the model for generating code patches.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how to use CodeLlama 2 for code generation tasks, specifically focusing on creating post-patch code snippets from pre-patch versions. This can be useful for automated bug fixing, code refactoring, or generating alternative implementations.

## Setup Instructions

To run this script, you need to install the required dependencies:


Additionally, ensure you have the `transformers` library installed, which provides access to the CodeLlama models.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install the required packages:

3. Run the script:

4. The script will load the dataset, fine-tune the model, and then generate post-patch code snippets.

## Configuration

You can modify the following parameters in the `Code_llama_Fine_Tuning_Post_Patch_Generation.ipynb` file:

- `MODEL_NAME`: Specify the CodeLlama model name (e.g., "codellama/CodeLlama-7b-Python-hf")
- `DATASET_FILE`: Path to your dataset file
- `OUTPUT_DIR`: Directory to save generated code snippets
